## About DAWN
DAWN (Decentralized Autonomous Wireless Network) is a DePIN project that aims to create a user-owned broadband network by combining on-chain protocols with physical hardware (antennas, validators, "black box" devices, etc.). DAWN enables property owners and operators to buy/sell or share Internet capacity and earn rewards through a decentralized marketplace.

## What is DePIN?
DePIN stands for **Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks** — the class of projects that decentralize and tokenise real-world infrastructure (connectivity, sensors, storage, compute, energy, etc.) so participants can run hardware and earn crypto-incentivized rewards. DePIN projects bridge blockchain economics with physical devices and real-world services.

## How DAWN Works (high level)
1. **Hardware layer** — on-the-ground devices (antennas, the DAWN Black Box, validators) provide wireless access and measure backhaul/location/frequency proofs.
2. **Protocol layer** — a marketplace and on-chain logic (example: Solana-based market implementations) coordinate capacity offers, reputation, and on-chain proofs.
3. **Incentive layer** — tokenomics / rewards enable operators to earn for providing bandwidth, validating signals, or hosting nodes; institutional investors and funds have also shown interest in DAWN.
